`forum.defence-force.org` is the phpBB community forum of the Defence Force site — the main active discussion board for the Oric family of computers. It is the community arm of [[defence-force.org]] and the OSDK project, and the place where Oric users and developers ask hardware troubleshooting questions, report OSDK bugs, share assembly and BASIC techniques, and discuss new hardware extensions. For this wiki it is the primary source of current, problem-specific community knowledge — and a searchable archive when a question is not answered by the other sources.

## What it does

The forum is a standard phpBB message board dedicated entirely to the Oric. It hosts 16 sub-forums covering general discussion, magazines and books, games, demos, operating systems, emulators, cross-development tools, disk/tape converters, graphics and audio tooling, the AY sound chip, BASIC, 6502 assembly, C, technical questions, and hardware hacks. It is moderately busy and long-running — the largest sub-forums hold thousands of posts (Games ~7,400, General Discussion ~6,300, Hardware hacks ~5,000).

## Forum structure

The 16 sub-forums, with their topic/post counts at capture time:

- **General Discussion** (663 / 6325) — anything off-topic for the other forums.
- **Mags and books** (74 / 701) — Oric magazines (CEO Mag, OUM, Rhetoric, Théoric, Hebdogiciel) and books.
- **Games** (341 / 7441) — Oric games, existing and wished-for.
- **Demos** (68 / 746) — Oric demo discussion.
- **Operating systems, utilities and other serious software** (91 / 1064) — Sedoric, Randos and other Oric DOSes.
- **Emulators** (158 / 2541) — Euphoric, MESS, Amoric and other emulators.
- **Cross development tools** (152 / 1464) — the OSDK: bug reports, feature requests, usage help.
- **Tape and floppy disk converters** (73 / 1437) — Tap2Wav, Tap2CD, Tap2Dsk, Sedoric Disc Manager, tape header editors.
- **Painting tricks** (54 / 652) — techniques for the Oric video chip.
- **Audio tools** (29 / 401) — samplers, trackers, sound-chip editors.
- **AY sound chip** (37 / 283) — the most technical forum, focused on the AY sound chip.
- **BASIC programming** (72 / 569) — BASIC 1.x (Oric-1/Atmos) and HYPERBASIC (Telestrat).
- **6502 assembly coding** (106 / 989) — efficient 6502 assembly on the Oric.
- **C programming** (62 / 913) — C via OSDK cross-compilation.
- **Technical questions** (259 / 3310) — how the machine works, model differences, peculiar details.
- **Hardware hacks and extensions** (216 / 4999) — hardware vsync, adding a VIA or AY, modern extensions.

## What gets discussed

Sampling recent topics shows the forum is the live edge of the Oric scene. *Cross development tools* tracks OSDK releases (1.21, 1.22, 1.23) and forward planning ("Let's talk about OSDK 2.0"), plus alternative toolchains such as the Pas6502 Pascal cross-compiler. *Hardware hacks and extensions* is dominated by modern storage and ULA-replacement projects — the LOCI storage emulator, an "OCULA" ULA-replacement concept, and interactions with hardware such as Metaphoric. *Technical questions* is heavy with repair and diagnostics threads (Atmos not booting, DRAM oddities, Microdisc issues, VIA/cassette faults). *6502 assembly coding* collects concrete coding problems — page-zero usage, page-boundary bugs, fast HIRES fills, flood-fill routines.

## Search

The forum is publicly browsable, but the phpBB **search system requires a logged-in member account** — guests are refused with "you are not permitted to use the search system". With an authenticated session, search supports keyword queries over topic titles, first posts or full post text, restriction to chosen sub-forums, and topic-or-post result modes. This makes the forum a queryable knowledge base for specific Oric problems once authenticated.

## When to use

Use the forum when the other wiki sources do not answer a specific, practical question — a hardware fault, an OSDK build error, a particular 6502 or BASIC technique, or the status of a modern extension. It complements the reference material: where [[oric.free.fr]] documents how the machine works and [[defence-force.org]] documents the toolchain, the forum captures the troubleshooting and project chatter that only exists as community discussion.

## Ecosystem

The forum is one property of the Defence Force constellation alongside the main site, the OSDK documentation site and the blog — all covered by [[defence-force.org]]. Its subject matter overlaps the reference material in [[oric.free.fr]] (emulators, magazines, hardware) and the modern hardware projects in this wiki: forum threads actively discuss extensions and ULA replacements of the kind reproduced by boards like Metaphoric. It is the social and support layer of the Oric preservation community.
